If you're a torrentbd user,you can experience the bug easily. It's a private torrent site for file sharing.

Step 1. Upload a pre existed torrent in TorrentBD
Step 2. You'll get an error while uploading
Step 3. Refresh the page without leaving it.
Step 4. You'll see the error again and again after every refresh.

Finally look at your seedbonus score. It's changing without uploading any file.


Thanks everyone
